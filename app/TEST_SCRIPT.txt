Manual Verification Script
==========================

1. Ensure environment variables (`FS_USER`, `FS_CODE`, `MA_PROXY`) are set.
2. From terminal, run:
   - `curl https://yourdomain.tld/app/api/healthz`
   - `curl https://yourdomain.tld/app/api/stations`
   Both should return JSON with `ok:true`. Upstream requests require the `XSRF-TOKEN` from the initial login and are always sent via `MA_PROXY`.
3. Open `https://yourdomain.tld/app/public/index.html` in a browser.
   - Stations list should load within a few seconds.
4. Click a station to view details.
   - KPI cards show current power, today energy, lifetime energy.
   - Devices table lists inverters/meters.
   - Alarms table lists active alarms.
5. Wait 60s and confirm data refreshes (Last updated time changes).
6. Toggle light/dark mode and ensure preference persists after reload.
